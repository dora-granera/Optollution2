              <p id="welcome">Welcome to Optollution Glasses! </p>
 <p class="pollution"> The Optollution Glasses is a product created by Company "Optollution" in order to show a new perspective to society about the importance of pollution and how it can affect communities from all over, specifically Low income. We are focusing on creating an app that will allow you to connect to the glasses through bluetooth (the same process as an Apple watch for reference). </p>
        
              <p class="pollution">Pollution can be made up from different types of toxins such as Co2, PM 2.5, and Ozone which are all hazardous to the health of citizens, animals and crops that we strongly rely on. </p>
              
              <p class="pollution"> In this case, the creation of Optollution Glasses is a new source to keep citizens aware of what's floating around them and to keep track of  what they're breathing inside into their internal bodies.</p>
              
              <p class="pollution"> Our intent here is to show and explain a brief overview of what the app will do and how it can benefit the public. </p>
