They are represented through percentages which all determine whether or not the pollution state is low, average, or high.

            <p id="infoformath">Analyzing the graphs/scatterplots    above, there are some specific statistic elements that support the claim that the majority of the time we see refineries emitt hazardous toxins into the air. Looking closely, you can see there is a pattern of an exponential growth/decay happening by the points within the graph. One Observation that is seen would be the difference between the Bay Area and South Coast. The Bay Area has a high emission rate than those from the South Coast. We can infer that this is really affecting those living in that specific area. Especially those close to the refineries emitting those pollutants. <p id="yaxis">( Note: The Y axis within the Scatter plot of Emitted Toxins is labeled "Tons per Million Barrels.")  </p>
                               
                               <p id="infoformath2">In image #1, the bar graph represents a left-skewed graph that seems to be pretty wide which implies that everyone gets a majority of pollution in their area. Mainly the Bay Area. </p>
                               
                               <p id="infoformath3"> As for Image #2, the bar graph seems to be a normal skewed graph and the highest representative is Shell Oil U.S. Refinery</p>
